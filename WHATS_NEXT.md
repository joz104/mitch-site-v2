# What's Next - Deployment & Content Roadmap

## üéØ Current Status: READY TO DEPLOY

### ‚úÖ Production-Ready Pages
1. **Homepage** - Clean design, real content, 10,000+ players stat
2. **Programs** - All camps with actual 2025 dates (July-August)
3. **Contact** - Spam-protected form with Resend ‚Üí info@mitchssoccer.com

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pages with Placeholder Content (Work Fine, Just Generic)
4. **About** - Has placeholder team members (needs real Mitch's story)
5. **Register** - Works but needs Pay-What-You-Can pricing UI
6. **Shop** - Generic shop page
7. **Media** - Generic media gallery
8. **Donate** - Generic donate page
9. **Programs/[slug]** - Dynamic program detail pages

**Key Point:** The site is FULLY FUNCTIONAL right now. Placeholder pages won't break anything - they're just not personalized yet.
